# DATA 180: Introduction to Data Science, Fall 2024

Welcome to our DATA 180 GitHub page! Here we will access the majority of course information including homeworks, code, exams, and datasets. Throughout the semester, in addition to learning about data science, coding with R, and how to build some ML models, you will also familiarize yourself with how GitHub works. For now, take some time to explore our class files here and ensure you can access everything that you will need in the class. If you have any questions, please get in touch!

# How to submit an assignment on GitHub

- Accept my hw invitation link (this automatically creates a clone repo just for you)
- On this repo, hit Code -> Open with Github Desktop
- In Github Desktop -> hit Show in Finder (or explorer if you are on Windows)
- In your local Finder window, you will see the hw folder, e.g., hw0, go inside, work on the assignment.
- Once you are finished, save your changes in RStudio.
- Go back to Github Desktop, you will see that it recognized your changes in your local file, and it’s waiting for you to commit. Go ahead and commit (you must add a short comment at this stage about what changes you have made.)
- Push your changes by clicking on “Push origin” (blue button in the middle of Github Desktop window). You are done!
